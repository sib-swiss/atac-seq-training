## Learning outcomes

### General learning outcomes

It will also cover main steps and available tools for the bioinformatics analysis of bulk ATAC-seq data, including:

This course will provide an introduction into ATAC-seq technology and its main applications to answer epigenetics related questions.

 * Recap of the steps involved in processing and aligning the raw reads
 * Quality control assessment specific to ATAC-seq
 * Peak calling, annotation and visualisation
 * Differential accessibility (DA) analysis
 * Functional enrichment analysis of DA peaks

Theoretical and practical sessions will be combined to provide broad context on ATAC-seq analysis methods as well as hands on experience using specific tools.



## Learning experiences

To reach the learning outcomes we will use lectures and exercises. During exercises, you are free to discuss with other participants. During lectures, focus on the lecture only.
